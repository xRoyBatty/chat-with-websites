Scraping with BeautifulSoup: The initial step involves using BeautifulSoup, which is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It is used here to scrape content from a website. The output of this step is the textual content of the website.

Text-splitting: The scraped text is then split into chunks or documents. This step is necessary to manage the data, making it easier to process and analyze. Splitting the text helps in dealing with information at a more granular level.

Vectorization: Each chunk of text is vectorized, which means it is converted into a numerical form that can be processed by computer algorithms. This is often done through embeddings, which are representations of the text in a high-dimensional space where similar meanings are encoded by proximal vectors.

Semantic Search: When a user queries the system (e.g., "What is this new website about?"), the query is also converted into an embedding. This question embedding is then used to perform a semantic search through the vector database, which contains the embeddings of the text chunks. Semantic search tries to understand the query's intent and the contextual meaning of the terms used in the search.

Vector Database: The embeddings of the text chunks are stored in a vector database. This database is used to perform fast and efficient similarity searches. When the question embedding is compared against this database, the most relevant chunks of text (now vectors) are identified.

Ranked Results: The results from the semantic search are ranked. This ranking is likely based on the similarity scores between the query embedding and the text chunk embeddings, with the most similar results ranking higher.

Language Model (LLM): The top-ranked chunks of text are then fed into a Language Model (likely a Large Language Model, denoted by LLM). The model uses these chunks to generate an answer to the user's query.

Answer: The language model generates an answer, which is then presented to the user. The model's output can be a synthesized response that integrates information from the most relevant chunks of text.
