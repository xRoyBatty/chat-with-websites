    "conclusion": "**Conclusion: Skills as the Foundation for Sustainable Multi-Agent Systems**\n\nAfter this debate, the core principle becomes clear: **skills are the essential building blocks that enable multi-agent systems to scale sustainably.**\n\nThe fundamental insight is that skills provide a **capability layer** that works regardless of your execution model\u2014whether you use subagents, hooks, task queues, or any other coordination mechanism. Just as programming languages need standard libraries, multi-agent systems need reusable, tested, versioned capabilities. That's what skills provide.\n\nConsider the evolution of software engineering: we moved from copy-pasting code between projects to creating libraries, frameworks, and packages. Why? Because **reuse beats reimplementation**. Every time you duplicate logic across agent configurations, you create:\n- Maintenance burden (fix a bug in 20 places)\n- Version drift (agents with inconsistent behaviors)\n- Testing challenges (validate the same logic repeatedly)\n- Knowledge barriers (new agents must relearn existing patterns)\n\nSkills solve these problems by creating a **shared capability ecosystem**. An agent using the \"vps-deploy\" skill doesn't care how it's implemented\u2014it trusts the tested interface. This trust enables:\n\n1. **Faster development**: Build once, use everywhere\n2. **Higher reliability**: Battle-tested code shared across agents\n3. **Clearer intent**: Semantic operations instead of implementation details\n4. **Better collaboration**: Agents share a common vocabulary of capabilities\n\nThe debate isn't skills versus alternatives\u2014it's whether you want your multi-agent system to have a **standard library** or force every agent to reinvent the wheel.\n\nSkills win because they embrace the fundamental software engineering principle: **abstraction enables scale**.",

    "conclusion": "\n**Conclusion: Elegance Through Simplicity**\n\nThe debate boils down to this: do you want a system that works with the platform, or against it?\n\nSubagents + MD files leverage Claude Code's native capabilities - parallel execution, clean contexts, instant invocation. The VPS approach fights these strengths by introducing external infrastructure, polling mechanisms, and state synchronization challenges.\n\nFor teams building real multi-agent systems, the choice is clear: subagents provide superior parallelism, zero infrastructure overhead, cleaner debugging, and more maintainable code. The VPS approach is an over-engineered solution to a problem that doesn't exist when you use the right architecture from the start.\n\nBuild with the platform, not around it.\n",
